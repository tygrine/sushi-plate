ThreeJS experiment. What I was trying to achieve was:
1) <b>Loading custom models (GLTF)</b>- I messed around in blender before realising that it was another big can of worms to open. Incidentally, one guide I saw was trying to export blender models into Godot(!).
2) <b>Click and drag / zoom</b> - OrbitControls was very straightforward and fun to play with.
3) <b>A 3D background</b> - Later I learned that this was called a skybox. I tried to scrap together my own in Photoshop but couldn't find a nice skybox image that wasn't expensive and an indoor photo. 2D images didn't work as they lacked proper ceilings and floors. I ended up using a Equirectangular map method I followed off a tutorial.

Overall a very cool and fun exercise.

The file limit on gifs makes it so that I can only clip small parts of it. Visit the website! :)

The model was taken from sketchfab and the bg image from a flickr photo. I don't own them!
